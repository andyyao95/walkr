Consider the intersection of two spaces: the complete solution space
to Ax = b and the N-simplex. The intersection of these two spaces is
a non-negative convex polytope. The R package walkr samples from this
intersection using two Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods:
hit-and-run [@kannan] and Dikin walk [@vempala]. Walkr also provide tools to examine sample
quality [@shinystan].

MCMC sampling is of great interest in applied statistics, as it is a common approach to sample
data drawn from a theoretical distribution [@gelman]. In application, walkr will be a powerful tool for estimating
expectations for Bayesian statistics. The walkr package will also be found useful by users who are
interested in generating random weight vectors in high dimensions given specific constraints.

The real world application to MCMC sampling is vast. In the context of finance, we've had users use
walkr to generate random portfolios satisfying specific constraints. We've also had users use walkr to sample from
solution spaces obtained empirically from mass spectrometry analysis of proteins, which can provide
insight into the biological systems of interest.
Finally, walkr is one of the first open-sourced softwares to implement the Dikin walk.

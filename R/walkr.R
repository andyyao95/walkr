#' The Walkr Function 
#' 
#' Given \eqn{Ax = b}, \code{walkr} samples points from the intersection of 
#' \eqn{Ax = b} with the n-simplex (\eqn{\sum x = 1}, \eqn{x_i \ge 0}). The 
#' Ax = b must be underdetermined, otherwise there is an unique solution
#' and there will be no sampling. 
#' 
#' Before the sampling, walkr internally performs the affine transformation
#' which takes the complete solution of \eqn{Ax = b} and that intersected
#' with the unit simplex into a space parametrized by coefficients, which 
#' we call the "alpha-space". The specific set of procedures taken is 
#' written in detail in the vignette. Essentially, the space is transformed,
#' the sampling takes place in the transformed space, and in the end 
#' \code{walkr} transforms back into the original coordinate system 
#' and returns the result. This transformation is affine, so the uniformity 
#' and mixing properties of the MCMC algorithms are not affected. 
#' The current MCMC sampling methods supported are "hit-and-run" and 
#' "dikin". 
#' 
#' 1) Hit-and-run is computationally less expensive and also 
#' guarantees uniformity asympotically with complexity of O(n^3)
#' points with respect to dimension n. However, in real practice, 
#' as dimensions ramp up, the mixing of hit-and-run is poor compared 
#' to Dikin. Thus, a lot of thinning would be needed as dimension
#' ramps up.
#' 
#' 2) Dikin Walk is a nearly uniform method known for its very strong 
#' mixing properties. However, each Dikin step is much more 
#' computationally expensive than hit-and-run, so it takes more time 
#' to sample every point. Thus, the "dikin" method
#' uses RcppEigen to speed up the core computationally 
#' expensive operations in the algorithm.

  ## 1. regardless of method, we need to perform the affine transformation which
  ## takes us from x-space (Ax = b) into the alpha-space in which the polytope
  ## described is Ax <= b (denoted below as new_A, new_b)
  ## From there, we could perform the sampling
  
  ## break it up into null space(homogeneous) and particular solution
  
  ## the user enters Ax = b (and we assume they want to intersect the solution
  ## space of that with the simplex) in order for hit-and-run / dikin to sample,
  ## we need a convex polytope. Therefore, we must perform the affine transformation (described in the vignette) which 
  ## brings us from x-space into alpha-space. Specifically, we want to 
  ## 1. represent the solution space in terms of basis 
  ## 2. rewrite it in the generic form of Ax <= b 
  
  ## First, we tag on the simplex equality constraints as an extra row in A.
  ## Next, we know the complete solution is written as v_particular +
  ## homogeneous, where homogeneous is an infinite set parameterized by alpha.
  ## An important note here is that the homogeneous solution returned by
  ## MASS::Null is an orthonormal basis. Since we have this alpha
  ## parametrization, we can write it as v_p + homogeneous %*% alpha >= 0 Then:
  
  ## Homogeneous %*% alpha >= -vp
  ## -Homogeneous %*% alpha <= vp    (Ax <= b form)

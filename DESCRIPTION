Description: Consider the intersection of two spaces: the complete solution space
             to Ax = b and the N-simplex. The intersection of these two spaces is 
             a non-negative convex polytope. The package walkr samples from this 
             intersection using two Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods: 
             hit-and-run and Dikin walk. walkr also provide tools to examine sample 
             quality.
